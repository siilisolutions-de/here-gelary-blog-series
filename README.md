# Blog series “Gelary”

## Building a web application from start to finish using HERE’s JavaScript APIs

Who wants ice cream?! — In this series of blog posts we are going to develop a small web application called “Gelary” using HERE maps and services.

Gelary aims to disrupt the ice–cream market by enabling ice–cream producers to deliver their sweet goods directly to their customers, wherever they are. The application will automatically route an ice–cream delivery to the customer. Routing will be implemented using HERE maps, taking the traffic situation along the route into account and considering a series of deliveries for optimised route planning.
The app will also be able to handle order changes: e.g. if a customer cancels or updates his or her position, the route will automatically be recalculated.
